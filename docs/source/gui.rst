.. _GUI:

pvMail: graphical user interface
====================================

.. index:: example

The PvMail program GUI is started from the command line with the ``-g`` 
or ``--gui`` command-line options.  
If either GUI option is used, then the positional arguments 
(``triggerPV messagePV email@address``) are optional.
Without either GUI option, the
command-line interface is started.::

	$ pvMail -g &

..	tip::
	Usually, you want to run the GUI as a background task by appending
	the ampersand (``&``) on the command line, as shown above.

	GUI of the *PvMail* application

The GUI provides editable text entry widgets for each of the required 
command-line terms (a.k.a. *positional arguments*): 
``trigger_PV message_PV email_addresses``.
The list of email addresses is separated.  The GUI provides a tool
to add additional address or remove addresses.

..	warning::
	At present, the GUI provides few visual cues 
	about the success of PV connections or even 
	that the program is working.  This will be fixed soon.

The GUI also shows (using *True* or *False* text) whether or not
the PV monitor process is running.

..	warning::
	If either of the PVs fails to connect, it is likely that the GUI may
	become confused whether or not it is running.  In such cases, press
	the *Stop* button, then press the *Run* button to try to restart monitoring.

All PvMail monitoring will be stopped if the GUI window is closed.
At present, there is no feature to detach or reattach a monitor set.
Also, PvMail can only monitor a single set of PVs using the current design.
A request to enhance this capability is on the TODO list (see :ref:`TODO`).

At the bottom of the GUI panel, a status line is shown.  At present, this 
does not indicate the status of the monitoring process.  Again,
this will be fixed soon.
